        <p>Plane-Box is game that is fun to play but built with a purpose in mind. In the world of security threats, improving password strength is a major focus. Some companies has swithed to picture based passwords to try and make their login systems stronger. The end goal of plane-box is to find out what pictures are harder to guess. This way companies will be able to gather a set of pictures that are the most secure based on the fact that they had the worst guess times. The more people that play this game the more accurate the data will be. We hop that Plane-Box will be affective at making passwords more secure as well as providing a fun gaming experience for users. </p>
